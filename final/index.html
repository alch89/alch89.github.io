        <h2>Purpose and Goals</h2>
        <p>
          On April 20, 1888, seventy-three businessmen founded the Lima Chamber of Commerce, in the premises of the Old Consulate Court (corner of Mercaderes and Mantas), today the intersection of the shreds of La Unión and Callao. Three days later, on April 23, Don Pedro Correa y Santiago was elected as the first president of the institution.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lima Chamber of Commerce celebrated its 131st anniversary on April 20 since its foundation in 1888, thus encompassing two-thirds of our republican history.

In a changing environment and in growing and irreversible globalization, today the CCL has one of the most modern business complexes in the country and has aligned itself with the cutting-edge technological platforms, in tune with the demands of competitiveness and the internationalization of trade .


        </p>
        <p>
          As "The Chamber of Guilds", the CCL has more than 15,000 registered companies from trade, production and services, which represent 41.1% of the total exported value and 52.3% of the total imported value, having projected to count when commemorating the National Bicentennial in 2021, with 20,000 associated companies.

Likewise, as the legitimate heir of the Consulate Court in 1888 and creator of the Registry of Protest Letters in 1928, the CCL administers by Law the Center (National and International) of Arbitration, guaranteeing the legal security of investments and conducts the National Registry of Projects and Defaults, contributing to the transparency of credit and financial operations.

In this way, in addition to being a senior business organization, the CCL is the most representative union to contribute to promoting the incorporation of Peru into the First World.
